function edge_list = calcSmallEdgeList(states,end_state)
% Author: Jonathon Kreska
% Version: 1.1
% Date: May 4, 2016
% Changelog:
%  1.0: Initial Release
%  1.1: Added Unique to remove duplicate rows
% Current Capability:
%  Generates: 1) a px2 Edge List matrix for Djikstra's function and 2) an nxn
%  matrix similar to an Adjacency matrix but the transitions have the robot
%  number associated with that transition. To save RAM, an Edge Matrix was
%  output as opposed to an Adjacency Matrix.
%  This function doesn't create a massive nxn array to save more RAM.
%  Also, I found it twice as fast.
% Input:
%  states = A cell matrix from userdata of all the states and transitions
%  end_state = the final state in double
% Output:
%  edge_list = px2 Edge List matrix where the first column is the original state and the
%      second column is the state that is being transitioned to; 
%      where p is the number of transitions


edge_list = [];
[n,~] = size(states);

for i = 1:n
  
  % Currently there is a problem with some FSMs having multiple finish states, 
  % some of which have no transition states out of them, checking size fixes
  % this but this might be an underlying issue with the fsm
  [k,~] = size(states{i,2});
  
  if i ~= end_state && k ~= 0
    next_states = states{i,2}(:,2);

    for j= 1:numel(next_states)
      edge_list = [edge_list; i str2double(next_states{j})];
    end
  end

end

edge_list = unique(edge_list,'rows');
